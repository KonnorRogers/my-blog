description: Getting started with Jest in either a new or existing project
  that does not currently have a testing suite. In addition, we will be adding
  an ESLint config that uses Jest so we can practice good code style

# Purpose

The Jest documentation on the getting started page was almost a little too simple.
It did not include where you should store multiple tests so I went ahead and made
this guide as a simple reminder to myself as to how to set it up.

This guide will also include setting up ESLint for use with Jest so that you don't
get funky errors.
