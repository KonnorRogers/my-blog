Aha! Awesome good stuff. I have a ton\nof packages from when I compiled Ruby. Piece of cake. I have my handy dandy\nVpsCli packages I’m good to go! Okay, here we go:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">curl</span> -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phpenv/phpenv-installer/master/bin/phpenv-installer <span class=\"token punctuation\">\\</span>\n    <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">bash</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># xyz happens you know how it goes, add XYZ to your .zshrc, cool whatever</span>\n\nphpenv <span class=\"token function\">install</span> <span class=\"token number\">7.3</span>.8\n<span class=\"token comment\"># configure: error reinstall BZip2</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Yea sure, no problem whatever, I’ll google, find the package easy peezy.\nAbout 10 compilation errors later and adding multiple packages to my VpsCli gem.\n(Which I really need to fix. I plan to have it take in a YAML file of packages\nrather than manual installs, but different problem for a different day)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Maybe next time I should stick to simple sudo apt install -y php…\nBUT! On the off chance I need a different PHP version I’m all set!</p>\n<p>After a lot of blood sweat and tears, I finally managed to compile php.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ParamagicDev/vps_cli/blob/master/lib/vps_cli/packages.rb\">VpsCli - packages</a>\nIf you look under Packages::LIBS it contains all the “sudo apt install -y #{pkg}”\nI used in the process.\nYes, I know the codebase needs some TLC to get it to where I want it to be.\nI wrote it ~6-8months ago. Maybe I’ll rewrite it in PHP?! Who knows! But continue\non this Laracasts PHP journey with me!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning PHP Part 1 - Lets Compile PHP!","date":"August 18, 2019","description":"What I've learned from watching PHP for Beginners from Laracasts"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/learning-php/learning-php-part1/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/learning-php/learning-php-part2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning PHP - Part 2"}}}}}
