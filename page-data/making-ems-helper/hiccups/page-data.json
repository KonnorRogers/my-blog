Upon further inspection,\nthe database provided at <a href=\"https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals/geoservice\">https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals/geoservice</a> does not have a complete dataset. For example,\nit only includes Westerly Hospital and the VA - Medical Center. As a result, I had to rethink\nhow to aggregate the data.</p>\n<h2>Using Wikipedia</h2>\n<p>Wikipedia appears to have a semi-complete list. May be best to look into this as a means\nto populate the database. They also appear to have a semi complete list of trauma centers.\nNo mention of PCI facilities is made on Wikipedia nor stroke centers.</p>\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, it appearst this projects is more data aggregation heavy than it is\ntechnically challenging. The time required to make the project work would be enormous.</p>\n<p>Either on my part of getting the data myself or by using community involvement\nand filtering in new locations. It just doesn’t seem feasible at this time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Making EMS Helper - Hiccups","date":"December 18, 2019","description":"Detailing a few of the issues faced when attempting to populate the database."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/making-ems-helper/hiccups/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/making-ems-helper/setting-up/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making EMS Helper - Setting up"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/javascript/setting-up-gatsby-with-docker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up a Gatsby project with Docker"}}}}}
